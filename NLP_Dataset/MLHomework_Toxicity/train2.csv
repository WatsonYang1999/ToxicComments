Polls and elections are really the only measures of what ""the people"" are thinking. There has been significantly less than 50% approval of Obamacare, and far less than that for socialized medicine (33%, according to Pew, although that's up from 21% just three years ago). And since there isn't a national election of any kind, the inference in Trump winning rather decisively is that more districts and states are opposed to socialized medicine than favor it. One can also conclude that in a number of competitive constituencies, candidates favoring socialized medicine were defeated in the mid-term elections following passage of Obamacare.

Also in the past century bishops from the Old Catholic Church (recognized as valid by Rome) have participated in numerous episcopal consecrations in the C of E. Apostolicae Curae's main points rested on the wording in the BCP as revised in 1552 under Edward VI, relegated to the dustbin by Mary I between 1553 and 1558, and then reimposed in 1559 by her sister Elizabeth. The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662. From Rome's perspective, all legitimately ordained/consecrated priests and bishops had died out by that point, and the wording in the BCP meant no one ordained since that point was valid. With the wording restored about 100 years later and the participation of bishops from the Old Catholic Church since the 20th century, it is possible/likely that the impediment Leo recognized no longer exists.",0.2

Of course, OAS could make up the difference. Make sure you know the math and it works for you before you start drawing CPP. I don't think people with pensions benefit much by taking CPP later than 65. You have to check whether delaying past 65 would also start hitting the Old Age Tax Credit.

The primary energy absorbing atmospheric gas is water vapor.  It is responsible for 95-98% of the energy detained in the atmosphere.  The other 3-5% is from CO2 and other gasses in the atmosphere.  Now lets look at the IR absorption spectrum
http://www.barrettbellamyclimate.com/page15.htm
This image shows the absorption wavelength of the various greenhouse gasses.  Please pay attention to the band of outgoing IR and the absorption wavelength overlap of CO2 and H2O. Also please notice how much more IR is absorbed by H2O.
As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more water vapor which holds more energy, however, this water vapor also condenses forms clouds which reflecting solar energy back into space reducing the amount of energy available to be stored.  The clouds condense further and then  rain or snow fall to the surface.

According to David Brooks, prominent neoliberal politicians included Al Gore and Bill Clinton of the Democratic Party of the United States. The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, The New Republic and the Washington Monthly. The ""godfather"" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist Charles Peters who in 1983 published "" A Neoliberal's Manifesto.""

Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left leaning academics in the 1970s ""to describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies.""

Uh, not so fast there....Travis is 3 for 34, .088.  Even if he goes 6 for 6 in his next ABs--2 good games-- that's 9 for 40, .225.  10 for his next 10 would get him to 13 for 44, .295.  To get to .350, Travis would hafta hit safely his next 14 ABs, go 14 for 14.  Think before you speak.

915,5400407,".  If the two go together to a licensed firearms dealer for the background check, it would be very quick, quite cheap...my last one cost $10..and the seller would have written verification that he/she sold the weapon to a ""legal"" buyer.  That process would innoculate the seller from any future ""misuse"" of the gun.  In my case, I consigned a rifle and a shotgun to a local dealer.  The shotgun didn't sell and to get it back from the dealer I had to have a background check.  10 bucks and no big deal.  

My suggestion would a) put the responsibility on the seller and b) allow those sales to relatives, neighbors and friends w/o a background check if the seller were willing to do so.  BGW: That verification could have a reference file number rather than the name of the buyer, however, before this law, personally, the private sales I've made of firearms have always had the buyer providing ID to me.
