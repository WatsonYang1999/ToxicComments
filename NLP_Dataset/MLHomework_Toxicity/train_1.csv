Most vessels that currently load in Vancouver go to refineries in Washington State, California or Hawaii. Traders said the price of Canadian crude shipped to Asia needs to be low enough to offset the cost of shipping across the Pacific on smaller vessels.

As the atmosphere warms, it can hold more water vapor which holds more energy, however, this water vapor also condenses forms clouds which reflecting solar energy back into space reducing the amount of energy available to be stored.

This also goes for a travel ban. Some form of control can be done constitutionally— like the one we already have to which we can add even more. This latest attempt may now go back to the Federal District courts, and to the Federal Appeals Courts before it it heard by the US Supreme Court.— do not be surprised.",0.0

The neoliberals coalesced around two magazines, The New Republic and the Washington Monthly. The ""godfather"" of this version of neoliberalism was the journalist Charles Peters who in 1983 published "" A Neoliberal's Manifesto.""

Shermer argued that the term gained popularity largely among left leaning academics in the 1970s ""to describe and decry a late twentieth-century effort by policy makers, think-tank experts, and industrialists to condemn social-democratic reforms and unapologetically implement free-market policies.""

Granted, he is an advocate for mercy, but that mercy is for people who have made mistakes anyone could make, for people who have been victimized by violent spouses, and so on. Mistakes aren't sins and we don't need salvation from them, but we keep mumbling about sin and salvation as if that's the only way to understand our relationship with God. 
I prefer to think that God raises up people to help us make course corrections, not to judge and condemn us if we don't get it right.

If all the premises are true - your answer MUST be true.

Blame is a relatively juvenile concept.  Discussion of efficacy of method as an attempt to optimize future results provides benefit.  If method employed is observed to lead to unfortunate results, it is profitable to examine that method and determine whether changes could reduce or eliminate unfortunate results observed.  The LE tactic of immediate confront and control is very widespread and precludes calm and careful evaluation of unknown situations which you point out they routinely encounter.  Rather than breaking a door down and surprising a ""perp"" who then reacts without thinking, a more restrained engagement technique could be employed.

Other methods have lower success rates (success being an unfortunate term here). Where guns are easily accessible, suicide rates are higher. Attempts might not be, but fulfillment of the act is.

About damn time we started holding the oily corporations accountable.

.
$771,000 in fines against Nordaq Energy, saying it has failed to properly seal two natural gas exploration wells in the Cook Inlet basin.

When the fine for not plugging wells is that much higher than the bonding required, and the commission says the bonding won't come close to paying for the mess left behind, it's long past time to demand the oily's post adequate bonding.
.


Oil and gas companies which operated in Alaska that have received protection in the last year after filing for bankruptcy are: Cook Inlet Energy, Aurora Gas and Linc Energy.

.
The history of outside companies and foreign corporations is dotted with many examples of skipping out on development requirements like plugging wells, decommissioning platforms, remediation work, and mine reclamation.

.
It's happened countless times in Alaska.

Time for this to be addressed and remedied.

To explain a gov't shortfall. In 1980 there was a $6 billion deficit in the indexing account for gov;t employees. The 1980 Actuarial Report notes that the actuarial cost of indexing, the % of salary which should go in the account, was 4.7% of salary. The gov't was depositing 1% then 2% of salary. 
Gross under funding. So the taxpayer paid $6 billion, what should have been paid in small pieces all along.

Then look at the indexed pension. The actuaries calculated the cost as 16.2% of salary. Rather than deposit 16.2% of salary, the gov't deposited 1% of salary for indexing, plus 6.5% of salary for the basic pension,  and said the gov't matched that.

He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly & unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.

South Sudan is indeed Christian - and it has been persecuted by the northern Islamists for decades

""The Sudanese  civil war culminates a long history in which the North has tried to spread its religion and language to the South, which has resisted these efforts. The introduction of Islam in the seventh century , primarily by traders, then led to descent groups in Sudan tracing their genealogy back to Arabia; in the case of politically or religiously prominent families, they claim to have roots going back to the Prophet Muhammad himself. Islamization set in motion a process of gradual decline for Christianity in northern Sudan, culminating in the overthrow of the Christian kingdoms in 1504 by an alliance of Arabs and the Muslim kingdom of Funj. In due course, Islam and Arabic gained hold in the North and overshadowed and displaced  the indigenous and Christian cultures. ""

No, actually. Every one of these incidents has happened where the shooter expected to encounter no armed resistance until police arrived.

Dionne's myopic assertion that this only happens regularly in the U.S. misses the fact that it also happens in places where extreme gun control is already in place. The bad guys still seem to acquire and use whatever weapons they see fit. The common theme, wherever these atrocities are committed and by whomever commits them for whatever purpose, is that those they attack are not armed and capable of responding immediately and must wait for someone who is armed to arrive, intervene and end the attack. Americans are in a unique position to demonstrate this, and in fact sometimes we do, but that is not headline news because few if any people die except maybe the bad guy.

Each one played high school and college football, and probably youth football, too; each was subjected to practices and standards that would be considered much more barbaric and dangerous from his playing days when compared to what occurs now. Each is a testament to the obvious, that not everyone who plays the game ends up damaged for life.

In fact, rare is the football coach who did not play the game himself. In Oregon's case, each of these 10 individuals now earns, when incentives are factored in, more than the president of the United States. You can argue about misplaced priorities, but from a practical standpoint the average Oregon football player could do a lot worse during his post-playing career than to follow in the footsteps of his college coaches.

""B.C.’s tax, implemented in 2008, covers most types of fuel use and carbon emissions. It started out low ($10 per tonne of carbon dioxide), then rose gradually to the current $30 per tonne, which works out to about 7 cents per litre of gas. “Revenue-neutral” by law, the policy requires equivalent cuts to other taxes. In practice, the province has cut $760-million more in income and other taxes than needed to offset carbon tax revenue.

The result is that taxpayers are coming out ahead. B.C. now has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada (with additional cuts benefiting low-income and rural residents) and one of the lowest corporate rates in North America.

Most of us focus through a very narrow view of life. It's obvious why: we're living in the here and now. Expectations of Gen Y and younger millennial siblings have been formed by their parents' generation. Uh-oh:  caught on the cusp of change.  And they don't like it! (Other things beside home-ownership are changing, and BOOMERS don't like many of them, either! Take the hint, boomerang kids!)  

However, just three generations ago, (the period ending in the 1930s) most Canadians rented, many of them their whole lives. This is the key: ""most people"" had no expectations they would EVER be home-owners. Many who served in WW II came ""home"" to quickly built rental bungalows called ""veterans' housing.""  My parents didn't own a home until they were in their early 30s. In the post-war BOOM years. 

Little kids today won't be too upset. They'll grow up knowing that ownership's for the upper-middle and upper classes. It'll seem normal and natural to rent.",0.0

Today I chatted with Jesus about your two-part post of yesterday on love. He loved it. He asked though that we do not equate THAT He died with the HOW. Of course they are related, and if the indignity and pain help to appreciate the depth of love, then fine. He asked us to remember that by becoming fully human, in time, death was ""included in the package"". The ""how"" is of historical significance. Whether He or the Parent foresaw/intended the how, though intellectually open, is essentially theological subtlety. 
Immersion into creation, death, and into the depth of earth and rising from the dead is the essence of Redemption.  All creation, all humanity have been into His divine Person and into the unity with His Parent, now our Parent as well as creator, t

The measure could provide up to $500 million annually through 2047 by allocating existing, unassigned revenues from oil/natural gas royalties that go to the federal Department of the Interior into a restoration fund. It wouldn't fund everything our parks need. The National Park Service currently faces an estimated $12 billion in backlogged repairs. But it's a start. More information on both the scope of the effort and a list of GOP and Democratic supporters is available on Derek Kilmer's website.

The largest deficit run under Harper was for the 2009/10 fiscal year when we had a $55.6B deficit.  However the cyclically adjusted amount was a $16.8B deficit.  So, by this measure, $38.8B of the deficit was due to the recession and $16.8B was not.

In total for the Conservative's 10 years when they delivered the budget they had $25.3B in surpluses and $145.6B in deficits for a total deficit of $120.3B.  Cyclically adjusted that drops to $7.8B in surpluses and $82.0B in deficits for a total cyclically adjusted deficit of $74.2B.

Walker & Mallott already have a BIG WIN on moving a significant portion of Alaska's Gas statewide, it's the federal license to move LNG/LPG on Alaska Railroad in both a north and south direction.  Intermodal-LNG/LPG when fully implemented can move 2BCFD of Nsloppy gas to global markets at a competitive rate if it's not operated by goofballs & crooks.

The ""all of the above"" approach to moving Alaska's gas to market is the best plan, but it fails unless we use AK-made flexpipe gaslines to glue it all together.

Of course, we'd have to pay for the mileage monitor, too.

There will come a time when 'the Church' will refer to Pope Paul 6 and 'Humanae Vitae' as the 'breakthrough document' acknowledging the fact that human sexuality is not always and only 'procreative'

Pul 6 acknowledges that, for humans, it is 'the natural law' that procreation is possible only during that period of the month when the woman is ovulating. And that sexual activity is permitted when procreation is not possible. And that 'family planning' is a Virtue.

He does contradict himself in trying to uphold former 'norms' prohibiting 'artificial' contraceptives; but once the rationale that 'all sexual activity must be procreative' is dispelled, the reasoning behind that norm is no longer valid.",0.0

I personally prefer eliminating all controls on medical care and medical insurance, but in the situation we have right now, opening insurance up across state lines and allowing people to pool into voluntary groups would allow all of us to get group rates like big employers do and that would drive down the high cost of premiums.

4533,4533,5069988,"Hello Tessgan,

Nice try at summarizing my argument, but you are way off.

Here is my argument:

Canada made a mistake when it chose to change its immigration policy about 30 years ago, a change in which suddenly we aimed to vacuum up, en masse, multi-millionaires from other countries - and it was a bad mistake, leading to skyrocketing house prices in Richmond and Vancouver and South Surrey and elsewhere that shut out local workers.

What Canada should have done instead was to have taken in EXACTLY the same number of folks from Hong Kong and China and elsewhere, but selected them NOT based on whether they were rich millionaires (investor immigrant programs) but instead chosen a variety of economic backgrounds similar to the economic makeup of existent Canadians. That approach would have nicely avoided the noted real estate mess.

I have never argued that immigrants are nothing more than foreigners and I have never argued that immigrants shouldn't be allowed to own houses in Canada.",0.0

.
It has nothing to do with sides. For instance, both ""sides"" of the statue removal protests and counter-protests were called demonstrations. What differentiates a ""stunt"" is the dishonesty. A legitimate demonstration honestly announces what it is and why, usually ahead of time. A ""stunt"" misrepresents some significant part of the event. In this case, Pence tried to claim that he had gone there to watch the game, and that his walkout was a spontaneous reaction to the kneeling. We have since learned that neither was the case.

I will give them credit for doing much with few resources, for being resilient in the face of great difficulties, and even for the level of very basic care they provide.

The soldiers who have fought and died in our military did so to support these ideals.  

Perhaps rather than snarling at these men who have chosen to respectfully protest you can take a moment to reflect on their situation, and try to imagine what it would be like to walk in their shoes.

The phrase ""but I say unto you"" can be found in many places in the beatitudes already mentioned above. No contradictions, rather, our Lord was explaining scripture to Israel for our learning.
He did that for Israel first, who rejected Him. He did that for us later, and today, through His chosen apostle St. Paul. He opens up scripture, not contradicts it. For us (Luke 24:30-32) through the breaking of bread.

The Sikh deity does no such thing. They believe a perfect being created the universe in a perfect way, and has absolutely no need for continued intervention. There are no prophets in Sikhism, and certainly no messiahs. There are only the holy books that teach people how best to live moral and ethical lives in the really-real world, and it is the responsibility of the individual to work to understand the lessons and apply them to everyday life.

While Sikh temples have dedicated scholars and holy men, the religion doesn't recognize any sort of religious hierarchy and no formal ""church"" structure, and there is no holy ordination.

However, I would like to point out a bit of literary slight of hand by the author. The entire first paragraph is fallacious. First, Trump didn't justify anything. He  pointed out that there are bad people on both sides that came ready to rumble. That can't be denied. In later statements he did speak out more forcefully against the NNs and WSs but continued to point out that there was and is hate on both sides. Hate is hate right, regardless of it's source?

Finally, Trump did not say that the NN's and WSs were nice people. He was trying (not very effectively I would admit) to make the point that the group of protesters referred to as right wingers, included many who are not NNs or WSs  but rather just ordinary people standing up against the government overreach of removing historic statues and telling us what to think.",0.0

Last year and this year I did two sizable transfers between BMOInvestorline and Nesbitt-Burns (both owned by BMO). My experience is the transfer time should be talked about in 'weeks' rather than days. The problem seems to be with BMOInvestorline. In both cases, after waiting a 'reasonable' amount of time (1 - 2 weeks) I called them to complain and the transfer happened fairly quickly after that. 

My conclusion is that Investorline simply doesn't allocate very many people to deal with these transactions (note that stock trades, for instance, are completed in 3 days). Hence if you call up to complain, your file gets pulled from the pile and dealt with.

- The report did devote several pages to FireSmart and the issue of vegetation management. Its points out that there is often considerable resistance to clearing the  vegetation that surrounds vulnerable communities. But there are certainly ways of maintaining aesthetics & habitat while keeping a perimeter zone relatively free of debris, with emergency roads installed, etc. In many cases the perimeter zone is likely to be next in line for development so it's work that would eventually be done, anyway.
- The report mentioned that heavy equipment was impeded because of pipelines. Pipelines should be buried deep enough at various locations so that heavy equipment can pass over them when required.

My point is that there are several 'lessons learned' that should have been included in the report. Perhaps the scope of this report was overly narrow... perhaps another report will deal with what was overlooked.",0.0

This new class of vehicle which is essentially a motorcycle on 3-4 wheels with a small trunk, and a heater.

Between the hours of 7-9 am and 4-6 pm, 75% of the lanes can be designated for only those cars. And 25% of lanes can be open for all other traffic.

Since these cars are taking up 1/2 or 1/3 the space, they will triple the road capacity during rush hour.

Even if regular cars are in the 25% of the lanes, by tripling the capacity in the other lanes, their 25% lane will move as fast or faster than these HOV lanes, and total volumes will increase.

Those that commute daily, will get one of the little cars. Someone making the odd trip will take the car and truck lane - but only in the designated hours.

It is not relevant how many people agree on moral principles. It is an individual choice. If you accept objective truths such as all innocent human beings being entitled to a right to life, there would be no confusion as to where and when empathy is appropriate or not. As a moral relativist however, you would be a fence-sitter on morality, thereby allowing for empathy to be misapplied.

As to your point on empathy, this concept gets fuzzy very quickly. One can try to imagine someone's feelings and emotions, but it will always be subjective obviously because it can only be imagined even if you've had similar experiences under similar circumstances.

Americans have voted in Trump as a reaction to the Democrats ignoring the working class for example. The unholy alliances between multinationals and governments  (read the space in which corruption thrives) are a natural result of our capitalist system.

But this abstraction can only be based on interpersonally observed behavior, as in market purchases or voting, not on the full range of an individual’s feelings.

Busted in Brazil 

In June 2001, while Paul was in Brazil, two things happened: One, the grand jury in the Eastern District of New York handed up its charges against him. And two, he filed a lawsuit against the Clintons and several other parties. In the video, Paul implies that the lawsuit came first and that the Clintons pulled the strings of government to shut him up because of it

Paul actually filed suit on June 19, 2001, according to legal documents, days after his June 8 indictment, and well after he knew of the investigation that led to it. Besides, Bill Clinton was no longer president at this point, and the U.S. attorney that indicted Paul reported to a Republican Department of Justice, which was part of the Republican administration.

 Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush.

The act called for the construction 700 miles of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border. It also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to deter illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles.  Bush said the new law would make borders more secure and hailed it as ""an important step toward immigration reform.""

CBO estimates that 1300 miles of building a wall would cost from $15-$48 billion.

Rep. Wm. Hurd who represents a Texas district with 800 miles of border:
- a one size solution for all 1300 miles makes no sense - what San Diego needs is different than Laredo, TX
- currently, the Mexican border is fairly secure - there are some issues but that has more to do with current US law - employers want workers.",0.1666666666666666

The reality is, rapists prey on people who are incapacitated. The problem is with the rapist, not how much women have had to drink.

People are so against tax breaks, but people need to understand that income generated from businesses is usually re-invested. This creates jobs for people. If you hold a hard line and say ""no tax breaks"", it forces companies to do things differently to avoid taxes.

Technically, Tam is right, however.  Rail can move 7,200 people in one direction per hour.  He doesn't say that rail will move people to where they want to go -- just that rail will move them.  It could be one foot.  That's the kind of duplicity that HART employs.

Why should the contributions of our Chief Lee be marginalized just because of his name? 

Further, here in the Northwest, where our history developed at a distance from the agony of the Civil War, the name Robert E Lee usually does not inspire the negative connotations you described.  We accept and respect people for who they are and what they do in our history timeline, not for what some may ascribe to the simple coincidence of a name.

I can see zero reason for a background check to take more than 3 days (given the fully computerized records).

The media is sensationalizing the issue for political purposes, because the public isn't familiar with the reality, allowing for easy manipulative sematicizing of the term ""doping,"" just like WADA doesn't consider doping that is done by prescription (as Western nations handle it) as doping. Doping is doping, and its a pillar of professional sport, just as dopamine is the cornerstone of human brain functionality and health.

Dao then knocked Long’s hand off his arm, causing the struggling Dao to fall and strike his mouth on an armrest on the other side of the aisle, according to the report. Long said he then dragged Dao because Dao refused to stand up.

We have an opportunity to harvest existing resources that Alaskans can pragmatically export. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline does a fine job pumping crude oil from the North Slope to Manuel Valdez and we have a fine pipeline that hauls another valuable store of oil from Alaska's Interior to the Port of Anchorage: Alaska Railroad.

It does bring worry to the mind, since, as Commissioner Bozievich said, at some point when the timber funds run out, Lane County is going to have to look for funding for many such projects. A strapped electorate won't vote for taxes, Lane County absolutely has to have certain funds in order to survive. 

It is obvious that Lane County needs to put a lot of effort into bringing a large company into the area, one that can actually pay taxes instead of apply for relief from them. Jobs are the answer to a lot of questions, including the massive homelessness problem. To transition from a timber receipts county to a strong county that has a lot of tax revenues and jobs from employment, that will take some real magic.

We waste money on private insurance companies and on Medicare Part D

We do not need to spend 35% of health care dollars on administrative over head. Medicare does what it does with a 2% admin over head

The main reason is the harsh penalties handed out to drug traffickers, up to and including the death penalty (see link below).

Fact: the 60-vote threshold only becomes relevant if the minority party stages a filibuster. Breaking a filibuster, or “moving for cloture” in the parlance of the Senate, requires 60 votes. A vote to approve requires only 51.  Neither of Obama’s appointees faced a filibuster. Nor did President Bush’s first nominee, John Roberts.  Seven of the eight justices currently on the Court, prior to Gorsuch, did not face cloture votes, meaning they were not subject to the 60-vote threshold to which Democrats are insisting nominees are consistently held.

He makes a similar statement that if Christ isn't risen, preaching is in vain as is faith. 

He chooses the concept of a risen Christ. And he affirms it is based on hope and unseen things. He recognize it might not be true by acceding ""hope"" as operative in the first instance and ""if"" in the second. But he acts as if it is true with his post-tormentor lifetime investment. 

No one knows for sure if the tomb was empty, why, and where the body may have gone. Not you or me, W. The gospels have differing accounts as does Mr. Paul. Eye witnesses are unreliable even now where we have cameras and instant deposition.

<i>Recent surveys have shown that the RF exposures from base stations range from 0.002% to 2% of the levels of international exposure guidelines, depending on a variety of factors such as the proximity to the antenna and the surrounding environment. This is lower or comparable to RF exposures from radio or television broadcast transmitters.</i>

As noted, it's about the frequency and the strength of the signal. The strength drops off quickly with distance. So if you don't suffer symptoms from TV signals, then you cannot suffer symptoms from a typical base tower.

Furthermore, if a county wants to fund transportation systems like the rail, the legislature authorizes the counties to surcharge up to 1/2 percent of the state GET. 
And that is it. That is the sources the counties are authorized to charge for county services. And that is to cover all the operational and upgrades that all county residents desire in their area.

===============

It is actually more like 2.9 cents/km for electricity vs. about 9.2 cents/km for a comparable gas car, at least in the case of the Tesla Model 3 in discussion.

I haven't seen final energy consumption numbers for the Tesla model 3, but it should be somewhere around 18kWh/100km, which would be among the lowest of any electric car out there today.  So 0.18kWh/km at a cost of about 16 cents/kWh (roughly what you are likely to pay on your bill at off-peak times) and you get roughly 2.9 cents/km.

A ""comparable car"" might be something like an Audi A4 with a 2.0L turbo; comparable size and performance.  That car is rated (U.S. ratings) at 8.4L/100km, or 0.084L/km.  With a cost of $1.10/litre (the price I saw on my way into work this morning) that gives you 9.2 cents/km.

The formal magisterium is not in the business of passing judgement of scriptural interpretations per se.

Typology and allegory were once all the rage; then there was literalism tainted by a ruthless effort to force complementarity out of outright contradictions (that got us, for instance, the attempt to use Joshua's sun standing still to deny astronomical discoveries).

In view of this categorization, and the lack of any credible support for the claims in the petition, it seems highly unlikely that the EPA will accord this ""petition"" anything more than an obligatory response and rejection, as is always the result of such junk filed by antifluoridationists.

Good question.

Because America has moved beyond the Cold War, and Putin hasn't. He's a reformed Cold War spy, an ex-Communist--and, like ex-smokers, we know what they turn into: oligarchical capitalists with strong totalitarian tendencies.

Capitalism in Russia has, well, Russian characteristics.

""What's happened their own form of capitalism in the image of what was portrayed to them as the reality of the West by the old Soviet Union's propaganda machine. They were informed there was nothing but gangsterism, gross and endemic corruption, naked profiteering, as vast, starving, utterly exploited underclass and a tiny number of rapacious, vicious capitalist crooks who were entirely above the law. Of course, even at its most laissez-faire the West was never like that, but that's what the Russians have created for themselves.""",0.2

We do have some options once the US ends NAFTA such as a fall back onto the FTA. However, maybe we do not want this. Maybe we should fall back further onto the Canada/US Auto pact of the 1960's?

But you also get nitrites in your stomach even without eating bacon.

There are at least 3 times more nitrates in a serving of spinach than nitrite in a serving of bacon. 

The formation of nitrosamine is not well understood. What everyone agrees on is don't cook bacon (and meats in general) at high temps. Best way to cook bacon: in the oven at 270. 

Another thing to remember. Most studies on the effect of cured meats were done a long time ago, when the use of curing salts (nitrite , nitrate) was not tightly regulated. There are strict rules in place now, maximum established levels of nitrite in bacon (120ppm at beginning of curing). Furthermore, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is added to bacon, as it's known to reduce the formation of nitrosamines.",0.0

Someone please help me understand this.
Bannon is the White House Chief Strategist. Obviously, he reports to the POTUS or to someone below the POTUS in the chain of command.
The POTUS has threatened North Korea with ""Fire and Fury"" and has also stated that the US military is ""locked and loaded"".
Now Steve Bannon made the unsolicited statement ""there is no military solution for North Korea"" and contradicts his boss!
Unless Bannon strategy is trying to kill Kim Jong Un from laughter, I can only interpret his words as an attempt of undermining the POTUS' statements.

Note that I clearly stated that CO₂ is ""the single most significant GHG in terms of INITIATING global temperature change"". The water vapor mixing ratio only changes with temperature, and is a feedback to CO₂ changes. And again, the consensus estimate for the contribution to the GHE from water vapor is ~50% (not 91%), and the contribution from CO₂ is ~20%. 20% of 33K is not ""3 C"".

Water vapor is indeed the closest thing to a ""black body"" selective absorber, but it does so quite near the surface. The energy balance is determined by the energy flux differential at the effective emission height significantly higher in the troposphere where water vapor is scarce, and CO₂ remains well-mixed. In contrast to your odd assertion of ""not much energy"" at the absorption band of CO₂, a quick look at the Earth's Planck curve with GHG interaction tells a different story.

The good news is - that is more than enough for most people's needs.   It's when you have to haul around heavier equipment and need a class IV or 5th wheel that you really need a pickup for towing.

Another thing is transmission and brakes.   If you have a really light vehicle, with small wheels and brakes - you might want to have  trailer  brakes even if the load is fairly light.  Also if you tow regularly - a transmission cooler is a good idea.

9939,9939,5003665,"Then by your own definition of ""diverse"", just about every people is already diverse, and your argument is moot. Every country in the 21st century is the result of centuries of conquests, domination, incorporation, or fights for independence.

As for Asia, that is precisely my point. Different empires existed in Asia at various times, with dominated people fighting for their autonomy from the conquerors, more or less successfully. 

But an empire by definition is one country or people dominating the others, whether it is Rome or Britain or China or the Aztecs, etc. It does that because it has a strong unifying culture it imposes on others, or that others admire and want to be a part of: Roman, British, Chinese, Aztec, etc.

Yes but debt is relative. 

If a company has an extremely low-risk business model that produces virtually guaranteed returns of say 13%, then they can go out and borrow money to fund their business at say 5% and lock those borrowing costs in at a fixed rate for say 25 years. A company like that can carry a lot of debt on their balance sheet and still be a low-risk investment. One needs to understand each company's business model, what they do, their contracts and how solid they are, the term of their loans, the risk of changes in interest rates to them, changes in goods' and services' pricing etc. and how all of these changes can affect each company. The level of risk is very different for a company that sells a commodity vs. one that provides, for example, electricity under a 25-year fixed-price, adjusted-for-infation contract. 

If you look at one number, the level of debt on a company's balance sheet, you have learned essentially nothing.
