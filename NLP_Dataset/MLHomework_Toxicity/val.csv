Polls and elections are really the only measures of what ""the people"" are thinking. There has been significantly less than 50% approval of Obamacare, and far less than that for socialized medicine (33%, according to Pew, although that's up from 21% just three years ago). And since there isn't a national election of any kind, the inference in Trump winning rather decisively is that more districts and states are opposed to socialized medicine than favor it. One can also conclude that in a number of competitive constituencies, candidates favoring socialized medicine were defeated in the mid-term elections following passage of Obamacare.

Also in the past century bishops from the Old Catholic Church (recognized as valid by Rome) have participated in numerous episcopal consecrations in the C of E. Apostolicae Curae's main points rested on the wording in the BCP as revised in 1552 under Edward VI, relegated to the dustbin by Mary I between 1553 and 1558, and then reimposed in 1559 by her sister Elizabeth. The language that was objectionable to Leo was removed in 1662. From Rome's perspective, all legitimately ordained/consecrated priests and bishops had died out by that point, and the wording in the BCP meant no one ordained since that point was valid. With the wording restored about 100 years later and the participation of bishops from the Old Catholic Church since the 20th century, it is possible/likely that the impediment Leo recognized no longer exists.",0.2

If not let's make sure that ""former"" is the perfect word choice for her! I will be a YES vote, so perverts need not attempt to change a normal safety issue especially for children, in creating odd unnatural edicts. Hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

98,874279,"With all respect to BC, the 90 mayors in Quebec that oppose the East West pipeline are doing exactly the same thing.
Under cover of ""we have to protect the environment"", they are blocking an important conduit for oil exports. And I am sure that if  they were offered a cherry, like BC got, they would take it and cease their objections.
With the threat of Trump's new tax policy, the 3.6 million barrels of Canada's exports to the US via landlocked pipeline (from which we all feed) are threatened.
Canada needs an alternative to export markets for oil and petty ""cherry grabbing"" has to stop.  For all our sakes.",0.0
99,6092481,"Kim's Convenience is one of the funniest programs produced in a long time by Canadian TV, and even more hilarious this year than last year,  but it got almost no publicity this year that it didn't drum up itself. Go on a news search and there is not one national story on it from any news source outside the CBC. How many Canadian entertainment PR shows, and not one thing their either.  Not one single review by any Canadian media source or newspaper. They even went on one of the biggest, longest, and most fan attended national publicity tours in Canadian TV history, and got hardly anything from anything in the media. That's the problem. Meanwhile, all those American shows got a ton of publicity from Canadian entertainment media. That's some kind of counter PR thing happening here.",0.0
